### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have worked to design and develop a framework to operate robots with ROS or ROS 2 and to contribute open source as well.

I have developed and maintained `TurtleBot3`(Official hardware platform for ROS) and `OpenManipulator`(Supports ROS and Arduino).
Recently, I am focusing autonomous delivery robot system including localization, path planning and tracking.

Also, I'm interested in artistic work (Especially, `motion` and `human interaction`). 

I have cooperated with several artists who are making [movie](https://youtu.be/6-kGALQmEk0), sound and [kinetic sculpture](https://youtu.be/ssun6W033rA).
I'm always looking for co-working with them to create beautiful artwork.
