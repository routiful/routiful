### Hi there 👋

I have worked to design and develop a framework to operate robots with ROS or ROS 2 and to contribute open source as well.

I have developed and maintained [`TurtleBot3`](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/)(Official hardware platform for ROS and ROS 2) and [`OpenManipulator`](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_main)(Supports ROS, ROS 2 and Arduino).
Recently, I am focusing motion control and tele-operation system for autonomous delivery robot platform.

Also, I'm interested in artistic work (Especially, `motion` and `human interaction`). 

I have cooperated with several artists who are making [movie](https://youtu.be/6-kGALQmEk0), sound and [kinetic sculpture](https://youtu.be/ssun6W033rA).
I'm always looking for co-working with them to create beautiful artwork.
