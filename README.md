### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Designed and developed libraries to operate robots using ROS / ROS 2 as well as contributed open source.

I have developed and maintained [`TurtleBot3`](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/)(Official hardware platform for ROS and ROS 2) and [`OpenManipulator`](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_main)(Supports ROS, ROS 2 and Arduino).
Recently, I am focusing motion control and tele-operation system for autonomous delivery robot platform.

Also, I'm interested in artistic work (Especially, `motion` and `human interaction`). 

I have cooperated with several artists who can produce [movie](https://youtu.be/6-kGALQmEk0) or design [kinetic sculpture](https://youtu.be/A0SC21MFM94?t=429).
I'm always looking for co-working with someone to create beautiful interactive artwork.
